    <h2>The Recurring Dream</h2>
    <h3><em>A story from England</em></h3>
    <p><span class="bigK">K</span>imberly Clark, who lives and works in London,<br /><span class="indent">England, seems like a
      normal young woman of</span>
      <br />
      twenty-five. She's pretty, she loves to dance, and she has <br />
      many friends. Also, she has a good position in the office <br />of a large
      company.<br /><br />
      <p class="indent">
      Kim Clark does have a problem, however. The <br />problem is that she has
      a mysterious dream. It's <br />mysterious because it is a dream about a
      person and <br />place which are completely strange to her. And it is
      <br />mysterious also because it is a recurring dream. That is, <br />she
      dreams the same thing frequently. Finally, she has <br />the same dream
      almost every night.</p>
      <br /><p class="indent">The strange dream always begins on a
      country road. <br />Kim stands on this road and sees a lane with a white
      <br />fence and a hedge on each side. At the end of the lane, on <br />the
      top of a little hill, she sees a small, white cottage with <br />green
      shutters. In the dream, shr then walks up the lane <br />to the house,
      goes in, and looks around. In one of the <br />rooms she finds a man
      asleep in bed. He is a little, old <br />man with white hair and a white beard. In the
      dream, <br />when Kim comes near his bed, the man wakes up. Then <br />
      he sits up and looks at her. When Kim opens her mouth <br />to speak to
      him, however, she wakes up in her apartment <br />in London. <br /></p>
      <br />
      <p class="indent">The dream bothers Kim very much. It's all so strange! <br />She
      knows no place or house like that. She doesn't know

She sees the same lane <br>with the same hedge and white fence. And at the end of <br>the lane stands the same small, white cottage with green <br>shutters. And each time, when she enters the house and <br>looks around, she sees the same little, old man asleep in <br>bed. And every time, when she opens her mouth to speak <br>to him, she wakes up in her own bed in London.
      <br><br>Kimberly speaks frequently with her roommate, Janet <br>Wilson, about the recurring dream. One day Janet says, <br>"Kim, let's go out to my parents' farm for a few days. It's <br>so peaceful there." <br><br>"That sounds like a good idea," answers Kim with <br>tears in her eyes . "The dream troubles me so much. It's <br>on my mind constantly." <br><br>Kim and Janet make plans to go to the country. And <br>early the next Saturday morning they leave the city in <br>Janet's car. As soon as they are away from the sights <br>and sounds of the city, Kim sits back on the seat beside <br>her friend and closes her eyes. A little later, as Janet <br>turns the car onto a country road, kim wakes up. In a <br>second, her eyes open wide. <br><br>
      "There it is, Jan!" she exclaims. "There it is!" <br><br>
      "There is what?" <br><br>
      "The place!" <br><br>
      "What place?" <br><br>
      "The place in my dream! Look!" <br><br>
      "Please, Kim, forget about your dream! You only <br>imagine this place is the same! There are many places <br>like this in the country!" <br><br>"No, Jan, it's not my imagination! This is the place! <br>There is the lane with the hedge and white fence! And <br>look! There is the little, white cottage with green <br>shutters! Please, Jan, let me out!" <br><br>
      Janet stops the car and torjs to her friend. "Please <br> don't go up there. Kim! It's not a good idea! Let's go on!"
